# Introduction

Mental health issues, particularly depression, have emerged as a significant public health concern globally. Among other factors influencing mental health, gender and education stand out as critical determinants. Studies have also indicated that educational attainment may play a protective role against depression, suggesting that individuals with higher education levels experience lower rates of mental health issues [@erickson2016]. Conversely, gender disparities in depression prevalence remain pronounced, with research consistently showing that women report higher rates of depression than their male counterparts, even when controlling for education levels [@kessler2006epidemiology].

This study therefore employs a statistical approach in R to examine the relationships between sex, educational attainment, income and reported cases of mental depression. An understanding of these dynamics contribute to a deeper understanding of how education and sex intersect to influence mental health, providing valuable insights for policymakers and mental health practitioners.

The key questions underpinning this research are: does higher education correlate with lower rates of depression? Are women disproportionately affected by depression compared to men at the same educational level? Can we develop a model that predicts the likelihood of psychological distress [@kessler_kessler_2012] given certain characteristics of an individual such as sex, education or age? To address these questions, we analyze national census data through various statistical methods, focusing on the intersection of gender, education, and mental health outcomes [@blewett_ipums_2023].

Predictive models - even simplified ones like the one we present below - are useful for understanding complex issues like mental health. They allow researchers and policymakers to quickly spot trends and make better decisions. By looking at how factors like sex and education connect to depression, these models show patterns which lets us identify at-risk groups early, and lets us provide tailored support and resources to those who need it most. Plus, predictive models help direct future research by pointing out where more exploration is needed, ensuring we keep learning and improving our approach to mental health. Being able to predict and tackle what affects mental health is key to building healthier communities.

The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: @sec-data presents the data and methodology, detailing the statistical techniques used for analysis. @sec-model-desc discusses the modeling strategy and expected outcomes, followed by a presentation of results in @sec-result. Finally, @sec-discussion engages in a critical discussion of our findings, addressing their implications for future research and policy.

# Data {#sec-data}

## Overview
We used the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) dataset from the Integrated Public Use Microdata Series, which contains microdata from different time points related to U.S. healthcare expenditures [@blewett_ipums_2023]. We performed all analysis using a popular statistical language called R [@citeR]. Our dataset contains age, sex, marital status, race, highest level of education attainment, total personal income, and K6 score [@kessler_kessler_2012]. All the variable definitions can be found in the Appendix [-@sec-appendix-data-details].

Our goal was to identify respondents, based on gender and education, who were suffering from non-specific psychological distress based on the Kessler scale before and after the COVID-19 pandemic. To support our analyses, we split into two datasets for 2018 and 2021. We excluded the respondents whose ages are below 19 and over 80. After enforcing our inclusion criteria, we had 14146 respondents for 2018 and 11383 for 2021. To give a preview of our data, @tbl-2018 and @tbl-2021 show the first five rows for each row for 2018 and 2021, respectively.

## Measurement

### Gender and Mental Health

Research consistently shows that women report higher rates of depression than men [@van_de_velde_gender_2010]. Biological, social, and psychological factors contribute to this disparity. Women may experience unique stressors, such as role strain from balancing work and family obligations, as well as being subject to gender-based discrimination. Townsend et al. see this as, "competing demands between work and the gendered expectations of domestic labor for women", which can "result in relatively more workâ€“family conflict." Plus, they note that "this tension between work and family tends to increase among women over their lifetime" [@townsend_holding_2024]. These pressures can exacerbate mental health issues, leading to higher rates of depression among women, particularly those  in lower socioeconomic or educational strata.

### Educational Attainment and Mental Health

Education is often seen as a protective factor against mental health issues. Studies have mixed results when studying if higher levels of education correlate with improved mental health outcomes [@tabor_mental_2021]. Educated individuals do, however, tend to have better access to mental health resources, higher socioeconomic status, and greater job security, all of which contribute to lower rates of depression. Indeed, socioeconomic factor "is a consistent and reliable predictor of a vast array of outcomes across the life span, including physical and psychological health." [@noauthor_education_nodate]. Conversely, those with lower education levels may face more financial strain, reduced employment opportunities, and limited access to healthcare, increasing their vulnerability to depression.

### Intersection of Gender, Education, and Depression

Despite the protective nature of education, the gender gap in mental health persists even at higher levels of educational attainment. Some studies suggest that women with high education levels still experience depression due to external stressors, including workplace discrimination and societal expectations. Acording to Ross et.al., "Academics report stress and waning resilience, fatigue and exhaustion, and a destabilization of the work-life balance. Furthermore, these impacts are unequally experienced by women with children and those with caring responsibilities" [@ross_stress_2023]. Additionally, the mental health benefits of education may differ between genders, with men benefiting more from the social status and economic opportunities that education provides, while women may continue to face challenges related to gender roles.


## Outcome variables

The MEPS survey collects participants' K6 score for nonspecific psychological distress. The K6 score is a summed scale value, also known as the Kessler 6 Scale, which considers six manifestations of nonspecific psychological distress. A score of 13 or higher indicates likely severe mental illness [@kessler_kessler_2012]. The variable called k6sum represents the score in our dataset [-@sec-appendix-data-details]. We constructed a new variable called "outcome," where 0 represents the score below 13 and 1 represents the score above 13. We considered zero as a person who is not experiencing psychological distress, denoted as "No," and one as a person experiencing severe psychological distress, denoted as "Yes." @fig-respondent-outcome represents the number of respondents we have in the dataset who were suffering from psychological distress. In 2018, 544 respondents were suffering severe psychological distress, where the number of total respondents was 14146. In 2021, 513 respondents were suffering from nonspecific psychological distress over the 30-day recall period, where the total number of respondents was 11383.

## Predictor variables

We discuss the predictor variables in this section. We primarily use sex and education variables for our analysis. However, we also discuss marital status, race, and total income to understand our dataset better.

### Sex

Our dataset has 7312 female respondents and 6834 male respondents for 2018. In 2021, the total number of respondents is lower compared to 2018. We have 6015 female respondents and 5368 male respondents for 2021 [@fig-sex].

```

### Education

There are 36 categories in the education variable. Five of them represent the missing value or refused to answer. We discarded these values. We also discarded the 500, 504, and 505 codes as they represent overlap (e.g., 500 represents a Master's, Professional, or Doctoral Degree). We also merge the categories of education. Details are available in the @sec-appendix-education-recoding. 

@fig-education-2018 and @fig-education-2021 depict the overall education status of our respondents. For both 2018 and 2022, a majority of respondents have at least a bachelor's, master's or PhD degree, followed by high school degree.

# Model {#sec-model-desc}

We use the logistic regression model to identify the association between suffering from psychological distress with sex and education. We set our model following the @tellingstories guidelines with the rstanarm package [@rstanarm_goodrich;@rstanarm_brilleman] in R [@citeR].


Logistic regression is a commonly used regression model when the outcome variable is binary [@tellingstories]. For our dataset, we introduce an outcome variable, which represents whether an individual is suffering from psychological distress. As a predictor variable for the logistic regression, we will use the sex and education variables discussed in the @sec-data.

## Model set-up

For logistic regression, we are using the equation below:

\begin{align}
y_i \sim Bern(\pi_i) \\
logit(y_i) \sim \beta_0 + \beta_1 \times sex_i + \beta_2 \times education_i \\
\beta_0 \sim Normal(0,2.5) \\
\beta_1 \sim Normal(0,2.5) \\
\beta_2 \sim Normal(0,2.5)
\end{align}

Here, $y_i$ represents whether a respondent suffers from psychological distress. $sex_i$ represents the respondent's gender, and $education_i$ represents the maximum education attained by the respondent. We randomly select 5000 samples from our entire dataset to simplify the model for lower execution time.

# Results {#sec-result}

Our results are summarized in @tbl-lrmodelresults-2018 and @tbl-lrmodelresults-2021.

# Discussion {#sec-discussion}

## Gender Differences in Depression {#sec-first-point}

@tbl-lrmodelresults-2018 and @tbl-lrmodelresults-2021 demonstrate that the odds of being female and having psychological depression are higher compared to males. The findings are consistent both before and after the pandemic.

## Educational Differences 

We have found that psychological distress and education have a relation in terms of people who have higher education tend to feel lower psychological distress. Research indicates a strong connection between emotional well-being and education, as emotional learning is believed to be nurtured within the school environment and through the curriculum [@norwich_critical_2022;@billington_conditions_2022].

## Weaknesses and next steps

We randomly selected 5000 samples for our model. We have not used any prediction to find out how good our model is for detecting psychological depression. Our next steps are carefully curating the dataset, introducing several data validation techniques, and increasing the sample set.

# Conclusion

This paper presented an overview of the educational attainment, sex, and psychological distress among participants. By looking at the Kessler 6 Scale for nonspecific psychological distress (K6SUM), we found complex relationships between education, sex, and mental health in the United States. Firstly, the data revealed significant trends in educational attainment, highlighting disparities that exist among different male and female. Our constructed variable, outcome, provided a clear understanding of individuals' highest completed education level through group lumping, which is important for identifying populations at risk of lower socioeconomic status. This knowledge can help inform targeted educational interventions and policies aimed at improving access to higher education, such as increasing funding for scholarships and grants for underrepresented groups, expanding community college programs, implementing outreach initiatives in underserved areas, providing mentorship opportunities, and enhancing financial literacy programs to help prospective students navigate the college application and funding processes.

 Kessler and known as the Kessler 6 Scale (K6), asks about six 
manifestations of nonspecific psychological distress.<br><br>Kessler 
recommends scoring the scale by assigning 0 to 4 points for each of the 
six questions, based on the reported frequency of the feelings (i.e., 0 
for "none of the time"; 1 for "a little of the time"; 2 for "some of the
 time"; 3 for "most of the time"; and 4 for "all of the time"). The 
range for summed responses on the K6 Scale is thus 0 to 24, with 0 
suggesting the lowest level of nonspecific psychological distress, and 
24 suggesting the highest level of nonspecific psychological distress.

score of 13 or greater are likely to be experiencing severe mental 
illness.<br><br>Kessler's instrument asks how often, during the past 30 days, the respondent felt:<br><br>So sad that nothing could cheer you up? (ASAD)<br><br>Nervous?
